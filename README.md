# myAvrTerminal

myAvrTerminal is a very basic Linux terminal for mySmartUSB MK3.

This project is aimed to give Linux user an easy access
to mySmartUSB programmer for Amtel microcontroller.

Why a special terminal? Its because the programmer understands
only Windows encoded characters while modern Linux uses utf-8
encoded characters.
